In this repositry you will find four different machine learning models build in order to complete 4- dfferent tasks as part of my internship.
Here's a detail of all tasks:
Task1:
-Dataset: Student performance factor (kaggle)
-Build a model to predict student's exam scores based on their study hours
-Perform data cleaning and basic visualization to understand the dataset
-Split the dataset into training and testing sets
-Train a linear regression model to estimate final score
-Visualize predictions and evaluate model performance
