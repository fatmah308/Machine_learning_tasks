In this repositry you will find four different machine learning models build in order to complete 4- dfferent tasks as part of my internship.

Here's a detail of all tasks:
Task1: Student Score Prediction
-Dataset: Student performance factor (kaggle)
-Build a model to predict student's exam scores based on their study hours
-Perform data cleaning and basic visualization to understand the dataset
-Split the dataset into training and testing sets
-Train a linear regression model to estimate final score
-Visualize predictions and evaluate model performance
bonus:Try polynomial regression and compare performance

Task2: Loan Approval Prediction 
-Dataset: Loan Approval Prediction dataset (kaggle)
-Build a model to predict whether a loan application will be approved
-Handle missing values and encode categorical features
-Train a classification model and evaluate performance on imbalanced data
-Focus on precision, recall, and F1-score
