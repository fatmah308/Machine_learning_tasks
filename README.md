In this repositry you will find four different machine learning models build in order to complete 4- dfferent tasks as part of my internship.

Here's a detail of all tasks:

Task1: Student Score Prediction 
-Dataset: Student performance factor (kaggle)
-Build a model to predict student's exam scores based on their study hours
-Perform data cleaning and basic visualization to understand the dataset
-Split the dataset into training and testing sets
-Train a linear regression model to estimate final score
-Visualize predictions and evaluate model performance
bonus:Try polynomial regression and compare performance

Task2: Loan Approval Prediction 
-Dataset: Loan Approval Prediction dataset (kaggle)
-Build a model to predict whether a loan application will be approved
-Handle missing values and encode categorical features
-Train a classification model and evaluate performance on imbalanced data
-Focus on precision, recall, and F1-score
bonus: Use SMOTE or other techniques to address class imbalance, Try logistic regression vs. decision tree

Task3: Sales Forecasting Description
-Dataset : Walmart Sales Forecast (Kaggle)
-Predict future sales based on historical sales data
-Create time-based features (day, month, lag values)
-Apply regression models to forecast next period's sales
-Plot actual vs. predicted values over time
bonus: Use rolling averages and seasonal decomposition, Apply XGBoost or LightGBM with time-aware validation

Task4: Forest Cover Type Classification
-Dataset (Recommended): Covertype (UCI)
-Predict the type of forest cover based on cartographic and environmental features
-Clean and preprocess the data including categorical handling
-Train and evaluate multi-class classification models
-Visualize confusion matrix and feature importance
bonus: Compare different models (e.g., Random Forest vs. XGBoost), Perform hyperparameter tuning

Task5: Customer Segmentation
-Dataset (Recommended): Mall Customer (Kaggle)
-Cluster customers into segments based on income and spending score
-Perform scaling and visual exploration of groupings
-Apply K-Means clustering and determine optimal number of clusters
-Visualize clusters using 2D plots
bonus: Add data augmentation to improve performance, Compare custom CNN vs. pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet)
